# CyberDeck Browser Architecture

## Status

Accepted for v1 planning.

## Product Direction

CyberDeck Browser is a native Windows 11 desktop browser with a retro 1980s terminal and cyberpunk control-deck identity. It uses Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) for normal web browsing and OpenGL for the Deck Space 3D bookmark system.

The browser engine is not built by this project. CEF renders standard web pages inside native child browser views. OpenGL renders the application identity surfaces and Deck Space, where bookmarks are represented as Nodes. Live websites rendered as 3D textures are a possible v2 feature and are explicitly out of scope for v1.

## Chosen Stack

### C++20

C++20 is the primary language because it is a strong fit for a native Windows desktop application that embeds CEF, integrates with Win32 APIs, and hosts an OpenGL renderer. It gives the project direct control over memory, threading, process boundaries, window handles, and graphics resources while still providing modern language features for safer application code.

### CMake

CMake is used as the build system because it works well with Visual Studio 2022, MSVC, CEF sample layouts, native Windows targets, and future packaging steps. It keeps project configuration reviewable and avoids locking the build to hand-maintained IDE files.

### Chromium Embedded Framework

CEF is used for Chromium browsing. It provides a maintained Chromium-based rendering engine, browser process integration, request handling hooks, downloads, permissions, and web platform support. This keeps the project focused on building CyberDeck Browser rather than creating or maintaining a web engine.

### Native Win32 Windowing

Native Win32 windowing is preferred for v1 because it gives direct control over Windows 11 desktop behavior, HWND ownership, child windows, DPI handling, message loops, menus, dialogs, and CEF browser-host integration. It also avoids adding a large UI framework before the core browser shell is stable.

### OpenGL 4.x

OpenGL 4.x is used for Deck Space, the real-time 3D bookmark view. It is mature, well documented, available on Windows GPU drivers, and sufficient for rendering neon materials, grid spaces, hex prisms, cubes, animated Nodes, and camera-controlled bookmark layouts. OpenGL is not used to replace Chromium page rendering in v1.

### JSON Persistence

JSON is used for v1 local persistence because history, settings, and bookmark Nodes need a simple readable format that is easy to inspect, back up, migrate, and recover from. A permissively licensed library such as nlohmann/json is acceptable, with license attribution documented before release.

## Rejected Alternatives

### Electron

Electron is not used for v1 because CyberDeck Browser is intended to be a native C++ Windows application with direct CEF, Win32, and OpenGL ownership. Electron would add a JavaScript/Node application shell, a larger runtime model, and less direct control over the native child browser and 3D renderer architecture.

### Qt WebEngine

Qt WebEngine is not used for v1 because it adds a large application framework and its own Chromium integration layer. The initial target is a leaner native Win32 shell around CEF, with explicit control over licensing, process setup, window parenting, and OpenGL rendering.

## Major Subsystems

### App Lifecycle

The app lifecycle owns process startup, command-line parsing, single-instance policy if added later, CEF initialization and shutdown, main window creation, message loop integration, and orderly cleanup of browser and renderer resources.

### CEF Integration

The CEF subsystem initializes Chromium, creates child browser views inside the native shell, handles browser callbacks, coordinates navigation state, downloads, permissions, external protocols, and custom error pages. CEF renders normal web pages for v1.

### Browser Tab Manager

The tab manager owns browser tab creation, active tab selection, close behavior, per-tab navigation state, and future restoration hooks. Each tab maps to a CEF browser instance or a controlled browser-host object.

### Toolbar and Navigation UI

The toolbar provides the v1 browser controls: back, forward, reload, stop, URL entry, search fallback, tab actions, and Add Node. It must synchronize with the active browser tab instead of keeping independent stale state.

### Terminal Mode Injection

Terminal Mode is an opt-in visual mode that injects safe CSS into web pages where supported by CEF APIs. It should be toggleable, reversible, and scoped carefully so it does not grant unsafe page capabilities or break browser security defaults.

### Bookmark Node Storage

Bookmark storage persists Nodes as local JSON. A Node represents a bookmark and stores fields such as title, URL, optional favicon or thumbnail metadata, tags, timestamps, and Deck Space layout data. Corrupted JSON must be handled safely with backup or recovery behavior rather than crashing.

### OpenGL Deck Space Renderer

Deck Space renders bookmark Nodes as real 3D objects such as hex prisms, cubes, or tiles. It owns GPU resources, camera controls, picking, animation, neon materials, and layout modes. It opens URLs through the browser tab manager, but it does not render live websites as textures in v1.

### Packaging

Packaging will produce a Windows installer using Inno Setup or NSIS. The installer stage must include application files, required CEF runtime files, license notices, user-data path expectations, and install/uninstall behavior.

## V1 Non-Goals

- Building a custom web engine.
- Browser extensions.
- Cloud sync or accounts.
- Password manager.
- Ad blocker.
- Live websites mapped onto 3D objects or OpenGL textures.
- Mobile support.
- Cross-platform support.
- AI features.
- Proprietary asset bundles.
- Claiming production readiness before installer, fresh install, launch, browsing, tabs, Deck Space, bookmarks, and Terminal Mode are tested.

## Implementation Notes

- Store user data under the correct Windows application data directory.
- Keep third-party licenses documented before dependencies are introduced.
- Prefer permissive dependencies such as BSD, MIT, Apache-2.0, or zlib/libpng.
- Fail safely on missing GPU features and show a clear fallback message.
- Keep each future prompt stage small and verifiable.
